            <p>The invasion of Ukraine is an unwelcome reminder that my own father, Albert,  was subjected to similar ordeals imposed by a Russian dictatorship. His family were targeted by Stalin's repressions.   </p> 
            <p>The turmoil started with his grandparents being dispossessed of all they owned. For a child that was difficult to comprehend. However, nothing could prepare him or his family for the <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/dekulakisation-mass-violence.html"> programme of genocide </a> openly planned by Soviet leaders.

         After years of building up his farm Vassili lost everything to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivization"> Collective agency. </a> Its officials put him to work as a labourer on his own land, permitted him a solitary cow, and paid him in grain which he had to take to the mill to be ground.

        Additional  impositions on the family made life extremely difficult for Aliide. Part of the family home was reappropriated as a shop which sold farm produce and vodka.

      Furthermore, there was an attempt to snatch Aliide's sewing machine. An altercation ensued with Aliide and her children obstructing all efforts to remove it.

            Any remaining hope that life would improve for the Finnish-Estonian diaspora in Ingria  was dashed when Stalin gained supreme power in 1938. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge">Stalin's paranoia allowed  NKVD (under Yezhov)</a> to further purge the country of 'potential' enemies.  Albert and Salme were affected as they attended a Finnish speaking school but only Russian was permitted from 1938. This effected an end to their formal education.  </p>

          Months later, to extend the 'Collectivised' land the family home was demolished. The family of nine slept in a barn until a family of Finnish stock welcomed them to their small house. Thankfully, the Georgijevs found a larger home before the Winter of 1938 and in Spring 1941 moved 30km north to Vitino. There were air-fields around Vitino which provided employment for Albert and Meeta but as the war with Germany progressed these were targeted by the Luftwaffe. </p>

      <p>When the bombing became more intense the family (plus horse and cow) left their Vitino home for the safety of dense woodland. They dug a ditch into the side of an embankment and added a cover.  Here they were safe from the shells falling on Vitino but Russian soldiers soon discovered them and ordered them to move out of the woods.</p>
      <p>Aliide ideally would like to have started for Estonia (90km) but Vassili still had contacts in Leningrad (pre 1924, St Petersburg), less than 50km away.  </p>

<div class="section  section11">
  <div class="boxText boxText11"> 
     <p>En-route to Leningrad they ran into many travellers fleeing Leningrad including an old friend of Vassili who informed him of the German blockade and the apalling conditions in the city. As the airfields around Vitino were still being targeted the family returned to the forest hideout. Here they managed to live for two weeks before they were discovered.  </p>


     <h3>A Surreal Experience.</h3>
     <p> 
     Albert clearly recalled clearly a morning in hiding that turned out to be unforgettable for him. For some reason he and his sisters had been woken early by his mother. Silhouetted and silent, figures appeared high on the embankment.  Aware that they had disobeyed the order to leave they were anxious about the possible consequences. To their surprise the soldiers wore German uniforms but some spoke Finnish-Estonian, moreover they were seemed respectful. Albert remembers his mother conversing in Estonian and happily making tea for them.  This small scouting party made a lasting impression on Albert. The family were advised to get a travel pass from a given officer billeted nearby, and to stock up with supplies before heading for Narva. 
     </p>


     <p>Despite searching for food in and around the shops and empty houses in the Vitino area little could be found. In a surreal setting amongst the numerous abandoned homes was a grand manor Romanov-type house in which the Georgijevs decamped. Early next morning Albert and his father readied the horse and wagon for the long trip to Narva.</p>
     <p>
       Travelling east from Estonia retreating Russians who had occupied the country were a danger to the family heading in the opposite direction. German patrols presented no such problem: they were aware of the flight of Ingrians, their Baltic heritage, and presented a 'hearts and mind' approach mindful long-term of recruiting from a populace disaffected by Soviet rule.
