            <p>The invasion of Ukraine is an unwelcome reminder that my own father, Albert, and his family were subjected to similar ordeals imposed by a Russian dictatorship driven by paranoia.   </p> 
            <p>The turmoil started with his grandparents being dispossessed of all they owned. For a child that was difficult to comprehend. However, nothing could prepare him or his family for the <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/dekulakisation-mass-violence.html"> programme of genocide </a> openly planned by the Russian State.

        Everyday family life became increasingly difficult for Aliide. Part of the family home was reappropriated as a Collective shop which sold farm produce and lots of vodka. Public  access to the house compromised the safety of Aliide and the older daughters.<br> Aliide also had to endure spates of drunkenness from a despairing Vassili. </p>

      When an attempt was made to remove the sewing machine an altercation ensued with Aliide and her children obstructing all efforts to remove it.

            Madis and Maarja were not exiled to the East; when local agents came to collect them they could not be located and missed the train at nearby Gatchina. 
            For some reason there were no consequences and they were relocated in nearby Volosova. Despite warnings Madis and Maarja made clandestine visits to their offspring in the area.   </p>

            The genocide of Finnish-Estonian Ingrians intensified when Stalin gained supreme power in 1938. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge">New orders from Stalin </a> supported the NKVD to further purge the country of potential enemies.  To attack  the Ingrian culture at its roots all instruction from 1938 had to be delivered in Russian only. The education of Albert and Salme effectively ended as they attended a Finnish speaking Ingrian school.</p>

          <p>Another State Order extended the fields of Collectivised farms. The Markuse house was isolated. The family were duly evicted and the home demolished. The Georgijevs were made homeless. </p>
          <p>
           They slept in a barn until a family of Finnish stock took them in. Floor space here was so limited that the adults had to sleep in the hall and landing. Thankfully, the Georgijevs found a larger home before the Winter of 1938 and in Spring 1941 moved 30km north to Vitino. There were air-fields around Vitino which provided employment for Albert and Meeta but as the war with Germany progressed these were targeted by the Luftwaffe. </p>

      <p>When the bombing became more intense the family (plus horse and cow) left their Vitino home for the safety of woodland. They dug a ditch into the side of an embankment and added cover.  Here they felt safer from the shells falling on Vitino but Russian soldiers soon discovered them and ordered them to move out of the woods. Vitino, it was feared, was not safe. An alternative was needed. It is likely that at this point that Aliide would have opted to go west to Estonia </p>

      Vassili still had contacts in Leningrad (50km east), but en-route they were stopped by people fleeing from the horrors of Leningrad. Given the problems around Vitino the family returned to the forest hideout. Here they managed to live undisturbed for two weeks away from the front.  </p>

     <h3>A Surreal Experience</h3>
     <p> 
     Albert recalled a morning in hiding that stayed fixed in memory. He and his sisters had been woken early. They were being watched. Silhouetted and silent, figures stood still atop the adjacent embankment.  Anxious about being caught again they were relieved that the soldiers were German with a contingent of Estonians. Albert remembers his mother happily making tea for them.

      <p>By mid-March 1942 the area was occupied by German troops. Vassili secured a travel permit for the trek to Narva but he was not able to add to provisions. In an unearthly setting many homes and shops across the area were empty or damaged or both. Standing aloft was a grand Romanov-type manor. Here the two parents and seven children decamped. </p>

    <div class="item2">
      <p>Early on the morning of the 22nd March 1942 Albert and Vassili readied the horse and wagon for the trip to Narva.
        They spent four days and three nights on the road sleeping on the road side when night fell totally exhausted. Advancing German units had presented no problems. Indeed, they may well have helped the stream of refugees leaving Ingria united in their grief of loss of identity and hatred of Stalin. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Georgijev family reached the border town of Narva on the 25th March 1942. They were immediately quarantined, bathed and fed. Vassili and Aliide had managed to get the children to safety. They were all thoroughly exhausted and weak. With sleep and nutrition all would physically recover from the ordeal. All except one. Aliide died just days later of typhus fever. She did not have the strength to fight the illness.
