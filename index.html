            <p>The invasion of Ukraine is an unwelcome reminder that my own father, Albert,  was subjected to similar ordeals imposed by a Russian dictatorship. His family were targeted by Stalin's repressions.   </p> 
            <p>The turmoil started with his grandparents being dispossessed of all they owned. For a child that was difficult to comprehend. However, nothing could prepare him or his family for the <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/dekulakisation-mass-violence.html"> programme of genocide </a> openly planned by Soviet leaders.

         After years of building up his farm Vassili lost everything to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivization"> Collective agency. </a> Its officials put him to work as a labourer on his own land, permitted him a solitary cow, and paid him in grain which he had to take to the mill to be ground. The humiliation was complete. Sadly, most Collectives were mismanaged and despite political slogans to the contrary there was an acute shortage of food throughout the country.

        Additional  impositions on the family made life extremely difficult for Aliide. Part of the family home was reappropriated as a shop which sold farm produce and vodka. Public  access to the house compromised the safety of Aliide and her daughters.<br> Yet another worry was Vassili: enforced into a humbling submission his despair lifted by vodka. </p>

      When an attempt was made by strangers to snatch Aliide's sewing machine an altercation ensued with Aliide and her children obstructing all efforts to remove it.

            Madis and Maarja were not exiled to the East; when local agents came to collect them they could not be located and missed the train. 
            Inexplicably, the authorities relocated them in nearby Volosova and despite warnings Madis and Maarja made clandestine visits to their offspring in the area.   </p>

            The genocide of Finnish-Estonian Ingrians intensified when Stalin gained supreme power in 1938. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge">Stalin's paranoia allowed  NKVD (under Yezhov)</a> to further purge the country of 'potential' enemies.  Albert and Salme were affected as they attended a Finnish speaking school but only Russian was permitted from 1938. </p>
            <p>Months later, to lengthen State 'Collectivised' fields the family was evicted and the Markuse home demolished. The family was homeless. </p>

        <div class="item2"><p>
           The family of nine slept in a barn until a family of Finnish stock took them in. Floor space was so limited that bedding covered the hall and landing. Thankfully, the Georgijevs found a larger home before the Winter of 1938 and in Spring 1941 moved 30km north to Vitino. There were air-fields around Vitino which provided employment for Albert and Meeta but as the war with Germany progressed these were targeted by the Luftwaffe. </p>

      <p>When the bombing became more intense the family (plus horse and cow) left their Vitino home for the safety of dense woodland. They dug a ditch into the side of an embankment and added cover.  Here they were safe from the shells falling on Vitino but Russian soldiers soon discovered them and ordered them to move out of the woods.</p>

      Vassili still had contacts in Leningrad (50km away), but en-route travellers fleeing from Leningrad informed him of apalling conditions in a besieged city. As the general area around Vitino was still dangerous the family returned to the forest hideout. Here they managed to live for two weeks undiscovered away from cannon fire and bombing.  </p>

     <h3>A Surreal Experience</h3>

     Albert recalled a morning in hiding that stayed fixed in memory. He and his sisters had been woken early. They were being watched. Silhouetted and silent, figures stood still atop the adjacent embankment.  Anxious about being caught again they were relieved that the soldiers were German with a contingent of Estonians. Albert remembers his mother  making tea for them.

      <p>On getting a travel pass the family found few provisions for the trek to Narva. In a Dantesque-like setting many buildings across the area were empty or damaged or both. Standing alone was a grand Romanov-type manor. Here the two parents and seven children decamped. </p>

        Travelling east from Estonia retreating Russian militia were a danger to the family. German patrols presented no such problem: they were fully aware of the genocide of Ingrians of Baltic heritage. The German investment in a 'hearts and mind' approach attracted thousands of recruits from a disaffected populace highly motivated in keeping Stalin at bay.
