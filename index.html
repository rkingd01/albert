            <p>The invasion of Ukraine is an unwelcome reminder that my own father, Albert,  was subjected to similar ordeals imposed by a Russian dictator. His family were targeted by Stalin's Repressions.   </p> 
            <p>The turmoil started with his grandparents being dispossessed. For a child that was difficult to comprehend. However, nothing could prepare him for the <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/dekulakisation-mass-violence.html"> programme of genocide </a> openly planned by Soviet leaders.

        Madis and Maarja were not exiled to the East. When the police came to collect them they could not be located. 
      Instead, the authorities isolated them nearby Volosova. Albert's sister Salme, recalls that two cats, Ruti and Ints, and a dog, Pontu, were abandoned at the Markuse farmhouse. Despite warnings Madis and Maarja made clandestine visits to their children.   Image of eviction.  Source: <a href="https://dmitrievaffair.com/dekulakisation-1930-1933/">Yury Dmitriev. </a></p>
