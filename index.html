            <p>The invasion of Ukraine is an unwelcome reminder that my own father, Albert,  was subjected to similar ordeals imposed by a Russian dictatorship. His family were targeted by Stalin's repressions.   </p> 
            <p>The turmoil started with his grandparents being dispossessed of all they owned. For a child that was difficult to comprehend. However, nothing could prepare him or his family for the <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/dekulakisation-mass-violence.html"> programme of genocide </a> openly planned by Soviet leaders.

      Madis and Maarja were not exiled to the East. When local agents came to collect them they could not be located and missed the train. 
      For reasons unknown, the authorities isolated them in nearby Volosova. Salme (Albert's younger sister) recalled two cats, Ruti and Ints, and a dog, Pontu, being left at Markuse. Despite warnings Madis and Maarja made clandestine visits to their children.   Source: image of eviction.   <a href="https://dmitrievaffair.com/dekulakisation-1930-1933/">Yury Dmitriev. </a></p>

         After years of building up his farm Vassili lost everything to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivization"> Collective agency. </a> Its officials put him to work as a labourer on his own land, permitted him a solitary cow, and paid him in grain which he had to take to the mill to be ground.

        Additional  impositions on the family made life extremely difficult for Aliide. Part of the family home was reappropriated as a shop which sold farm produce and vodka.

      Furthermore, there was an attempt to snatch Aliide's sewing machine. An altercation ensued with Aliide and her children obstructing all efforts to remove it.

     <p>In Ingria all hope that life would improve for the Finnish and Estonian diaspora  were dashed in 1938 when Stalin gained supreme power. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge">His paranoia sanctioned Yezhov's NKVD</a> to further purge the country of potential enemies.  Albert and Salme attended a Finnish school but the language was banned in 1938 effecting an end to their formal education. Months later, to extend the fields the family home was demolished. The family of nine slept in a barn until a family of Finnish stock welcomed them to their small house. Thankfully, the Georgijevs found a larger home before the Winter of 1938 and in Spring 1941 moved 30km north to Vitino. There were air-fields around Vitino which provided employment for Albert and Meeta but as a war with Germany progressed these were targeted by the German Luftwaffe.
      
     </p>
     <p>When the bombing became intense the family (plus horse and cow) hid in dense woodland. They dug a ditch into the side of a railway embankment with added cover.  Here they were safe from the shells falling on Vitino but Russian soldiers discovered them and ordered them to move, but move where?</p>
     <p>Aliide ideally would like to have started for Estonia (90km) but Vassili still had contacts in Leningrad (ex St Petersburg), less than 50km away.  </p>

     <p>En-route to Leningrad they ran into many travellers fleeing Leningrad including an old friend of Vassili. Vassili was warned not to continue. The German bombardment of the city was said to be unrelenting. As the airfields around Vitino were still being targeted the family returned to the forest hideout. Here they lived for two weeks.  </p>

     <p>
     On one unforgettable morning Albert recalled clearly how he and his sisters were woken by his mother and told to stand in a clearing outside the hideaway. In the very distance up high on the embankment stood a line of soldiers in silhouette. Mindful that they had returned to the site after being ordered to leave they were anxious about a hostile response. To their surprise the soldiers turned out to be German, moreover they were respectful and polite. Albert remembers his mother speaking in Estonian and happily making tea for the lead officer and Estii interpreter.  This patrol made a lasting impression on Albert. The family were advised to get a signed travel pass from a given senior officer billeted nearby, and to stock up with supplies before heading for Narva. Despite searching for food in various villages little could be found. In some areas homes were left abandoned leaving a rather grand manor Romanov type house open to the Georgijevs. Albert and his father readied the horse and wagon for the long trip. One of the older daughters milked the cow and the family set off.

       Travelling east from Estonia retreating Russian troops were a danger to the family heading in the opposite direction especially if their allegiance was questionable.
