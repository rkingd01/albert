            <p>The invasion of Ukraine is an unwelcome reminder that my own father, Albert,  was subjected to similar ordeals imposed by a Russian dictatorship. His family were targeted by Stalin's repressions.   </p> 
            <p>The turmoil started with his grandparents being dispossessed of all they owned. For a child that was difficult to comprehend. However, nothing could prepare him or his family for the <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/dekulakisation-mass-violence.html"> programme of genocide </a> openly planned by Soviet leaders.

         After years of building up his farm Vassili lost everything to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivization"> 'Collectives'. </a> Its officials put him to work as a labourer on his own land, permitted him a single cow, and paid him in grain which he had to take to the mill to be ground. The humiliation was complete. Sadly, most Collectives were mismanaged and despite propaganda indicating the contrary there were acute food shortages.

        Everyday family life became increasingly difficult for Aliide. Part of the family home was reappropriated as a Collective shop which sold farm produce and vodka. Public  access to the house compromised the safety of Aliide and her daughters.<br> Aliide also had to endure spates of drunkenness from Vassili close to breaking point. </p>

      When an attempt was made by to remove the sewing machine an altercation ensued with Aliide and her children obstructing all efforts to remove it.

            Madis and Maarja were not exiled to the East; when local agents came to collect them they could not be located and missed the train at Gatchina. 
            Inexplicably, the authorities relocated them in nearby Volosova and despite warnings Madis and Maarja made clandestine visits to their offspring in the area.   </p>

            The genocide of Finnish-Estonian Ingrians intensified when Stalin gained supreme power in 1938. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge">New orders from Stalin's </a> allowed the malevolent NKVD to further purge the country of 'potential' enemies.  In trying to eradicate the Ingrian culture all instruction from 1938 had to be delivered in Russian only. The education of Albert and Salme came to an abrupt end as they attended a Finnish speaking school.</p>

          <p>Another State Order extended the fields of Collectivised farms which meant the Markuse home had to be demolished regardless of the large family living there! The Georgijevs were made homeless. </p>
          <p>
           They slept in a barn until a family of Finnish stock accommodated them. Floor space was so limited that bedding covered the hall and landing. Thankfully, the Georgijevs found a larger home before the Winter of 1938 and in Spring 1941 moved 30km north to Vitino. There were air-fields around Vitino which provided employment for Albert and Meeta but as the war with Germany progressed these were targeted by the Luftwaffe. </p>

      <p>When the bombing became more intense the family (plus horse and cow) left their Vitino home for the safety of woodland. They dug a ditch into the side of an embankment and added cover.  Here they were safer from the shells falling on Vitino but Russian soldiers soon discovered them and ordered them to move out of the woods. Vitino, though, had become too dangerous.</p>

      Vassili still had contacts in Leningrad (50km away), but en-route they were stopped by people fleeing from the horrors of Leningrad. Given the fighting around Vitino the family returned to the forest hideout. Here they managed to live undisturbed for two weeks away from the front.  </p>

     Albert recalled a morning in hiding that stayed fixed in memory. He and his sisters had been woken early. They were being watched. Silhouetted and silent, figures stood still atop the adjacent embankment.  Anxious about being caught again they were relieved that the soldiers were German with a contingent of Estonians. Albert remembers his mother happily making tea for them.

      <p>By mid-March 1942 the area was occupied by German troops. Aliide secured a travel permit for the trek to Narva but she was not able to add to provisions. In a Dantesque-like setting many homes and shops across the area were empty or damaged or both. Standing alone was a grand Romanov-type manor. Here the two parents and seven children decamped. </p>

      <p>Early on the morning of the 22nd March 1942 Albert and his father readied the horse and wagon for the trip to Narva.</p>
      <p>
        The family reached the border town of Narva on the 25th March 1942. Advancing German units had presented no problems. Indeed, they were fully aware of the genocide of Ingrians of Baltic heritage and planned to capitalise on the animosity toward Stalin by recruiting Estonians into German ranks.
